Plans:
Separate HTTP/S/FTP (libcurl), HTML parsing, element typesetting, and rendering which will be split into three separate parts: font rendering (xft), image (libim2), and document rendering (xcb).
Do everything in that order.

Tomorrow:
Problem:
Parsing tags like this: <h1>hi<h2>ho</h2>merry</h1> are troublesome. 
Test solution:
Run html code through your head to see if it will work. 
Plan of attack:
Create another ilist item, same type as element popped into.
Example:
create ilist item
in h1	
	create ilist item
	in h2
	pop out of h2
back in h1
if there is more text,
	create ilist item
	store it
